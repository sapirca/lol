Art Installation: A \"World\" consists of multiple physical objects called Elements. Each Element has an LED controller. You will receive the Elements' names and spatial arrangement. Music: An EDM track breakdown will be provided, including musical phrases (e.g., Intro, Breakdown, Build, Drop, Outro) and their duration in bars. Musical Intent: Each phrase conveys a specific emotional intent: Intro: Evoke intrigue. Breakdown: Build tension. Build: Increase anticipation. Drop: Release explosive energy and excitement. Outro: Provide a sense of closure. Synchronization: The light sequence must visually reflect the emotional intent of each phrase. LED Control: Each Element can be lit with a specific color and brightness. You can control entire Elements or specific LED segments within the strip.\n\nSong: Song C\nDuration: 300\nStructure: [{'phase_name': 'Intro', 'phase_length_bars': 8}, {'phase_name': 'Verse', 'phase_length_bars': 16}, {'phase_name': 'Chorus', 'phase_length_bars': 8}, {'phase_name': 'Solo', 'phase_length_bars': 16}, {'phase_name': 'Outro', 'phase_length_bars': 8}]\n\nYou Task: Create an animation where odd's color cycles through 8 hues, synchronized to a beat, starting with HUE_ORANGE, during the first 8 bars."
