Music: An EDM track breakdown will be provided, including musical phrases (e.g., Intro, Breakdown, Build, Drop, Outro) and their duration in bars. Musical Intent: Each phrase conveys a specific emotional intent: Intro: Evoke intrigue. Breakdown: Build tension. Build: Increase anticipation. Drop: Release explosive energy and excitement. Outro: Provide a sense of closure. Synchronization: The light sequence must visually reflect the emotional intent of each phrase. LED Control: Each Element can be lit with a specific color and brightness. You can control entire Elements or specific LED segments within the strip.",
