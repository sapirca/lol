song_structure_prompt = """
Song Structure: Possible sections include:
- **Intro**: Beginning, sets the tone. Often instrumental, gradually increasing in intensity. Evokes curiosity and anticipation.
- **Verse**: Tells the story, lyrics change with each verse. Builds anticipation for the chorus. Evokes intrigue and connection.
- **Chorus**: Most memorable part, repeating lyrics and melody. Highest energy. Evokes excitement and joy.
- **Bridge**: Contrasting section, different melody or feel. Often quieter. Evokes reflection and anticipation of change.
- **Build-up**: Gradually increases tension and anticipation. Increasing energy, leading to the drop. Evokes excitement and suspense. Often ends with a moment of silence or a dramatic pause before the drop. Can be leveraged for animation changes or blackouts.
- **Drop**: The explosive section after the build-up where energy peaks. Climax, most intense and energetic. Heavy bass, strong rhythms. Evokes euphoria and release. Animations should evoke similar responses and feelings.
- **Outro**: Ending, provides closure. Often fades out or mirrors the intro. Evokes reflection and nostalgia.

The interplay between build-ups and drops is crucial in EDM, creating dynamic shifts. Your animation should reflect this.

timing_knowledge_prompt = """
Timing Knowledge:
To calculate timings for effects:

1. **BPM to seconds per beat**: Divide 60 seconds by the BPM (e.g., BPM 140 => 60 / 140 = 0.42857 seconds per beat).
2. **Beats per bar**: Assume 4 beats per bar (4/4 time).
3. **Seconds per bar**: Multiply seconds per beat by 4 (e.g., 0.42857 * 4 = 1.71428 seconds per bar).
4. **Section duration**: Multiply seconds per bar by the number of bars in the section (e.g., 8 bars * 1.71428 = 13.71428 seconds).

Accurate timing ensures effects align seamlessly with the music.
"""

color_knowledge_prompt = """
