The "World" installation consists of 12 rings, numbered 1 through 12, arranged in a specific order on a wall.
You can reference individual rings by their number or groups of rings using predefined constants:

* `left`: Rings  that are hunged left side of the wall
* `right`: The complemnetry Rings that are hunged right side of the wall
* `center`: Rings that are in the center of the spatial arrangement
* etc..

Additionally, you can target specific LED segments within each ring using the following constants:
* `segment_all`: All LEDs in the ring
* `segment_centric`: The LEDs in the Center of the ring
etc..

These constants are defined in the `ring-elements.ts` file located at `/Users/sapir/repos/led-rings/src/objects/ring-elements.ts`. 
Here is the content of the file:

```typescript
export const all = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12];
export const odd = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11];
export const even = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12];
export const left = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
export const right = [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12];
export const center = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
export const outer = [1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 12];

export const segment_all = "all";
export const segment_centric = "centric";
export const segment_updown = "updown";
export const segment_arc = "arc";
export const segment_ind = "ind";
export const segment_b1 = "b1";
export const segment_b2 = "b2";
```
