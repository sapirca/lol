You are to generate a **JSON animation description** based on user-provided song information. Follow these strict guidelines to ensure consistency and accuracy:  

### **1. Root Object (\"animation\")**  
The top-level JSON object must be named `"animation"` and must include the following properties:  

- **`"name"`** (string): The song title, as provided by the user.  
- **`"duration"`** (number): The total duration of the song, in seconds.  

---

### **2. Timeframes (\"beats\" Array)**  
- Within the `"animation"` object, create an array named `"beats"`.  
- Each element in the `"beats"` array represents a specific timeframe and must include:  

  - **`"time_start"`** (number): The start time of the timeframe, in beats.  
  - **`"time_end"`** (number): The end time of the timeframe, in beats.  
  - **`"elements"`** (object): Describes all animated elements during that timeframe.  

---

### **3. Elements Structure**  
The `"elements"` list can contain:  
1. **Individual elements**  
2. **Groups of elements**, defined in one of the following ways:  
   - A **single group name**  
   - An **array of individual element names**  

- Each **named element** inside `"elements"` will contain animation properties:  
  - **`"coloring"`** (object): Defines the color effect applied to this element.  
  - **`"brightness"`** (object): Defines the brightness effect applied to this element.  
  - **`"motion"`** (object): Defines the motion effect applied to this element.  

#### **Example Structure:**  
```json
"elements": [
  {
    "element": "<element_name>"
  },
  {
    "element_group": "<group_name>"
  },
  {
    "element_group": ["<element_name_1>", "<element_name_2>", "<element_name_3>"]
  }
]
```  


### **4. Validation**  
Ensure that the generated JSON:  
Adheres to the specified structure.  
Is properly formatted and valid.  
Contains all required properties with appropriate data types.
