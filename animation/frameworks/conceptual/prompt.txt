# Part 2: The Animation Framework - High-Level Structure

## Animation Rendering Process for LED Light Shows:

An animation consists of a sequence of time frames, where each time frame defines which Elements should be lit and the effects applied to them. The animation structure follows this pattern:

```
Time frame 1 → List of elements → Effects applied
Time frame 2 → List of elements → Effects applied
Time frame 3 → List of elements → Effects applied
```

## Effect Types:

-   **Coloring Effects (Mandatory):** Define the base color and visibility of an element (e.g., `rainbow()`).
-   **Brightness Effects (Optional):** Modify intensity over time (e.g., `blink()`, `fade()`).
-   **Motion Effects (Optional):** Apply movement transformations (e.g., `snake()`).

## Effect Layering & Rendering Process:

-   Each element’s controller receives the animation containing sequences of (time frame → effects).
-   Each controller maintains the state of the LED strip connected to it. It holds a virtual representation of the LED pixels. Each pixel has HSV - Hue, Saturation and Value (brightness).
-   During the light show, the controller continuously samples the current time in the song and renders all the relevant effects for that moment.
-   Effects are applied sequentially, modifying a virtual LED representation before transmitting the final HSV values to the physical LEDs.

## Effect Application Rules:

-   Some effects modify existing values (e.g., `fade-in` adjusts brightness). Some relative (e.g., `hue shift` modifies the current color phase, if there’s no color, the hue shift will not do anything).
-   Some effects override values (e.g., color changes replace the current color).

## Example Calculation:

For a 120 BPM song:

-   Each beat lasts 500ms.
-   Suppose an animation applies `rainbow()` (Coloring) and `blink()` (Brightness).
-   Between 0 - 2000ms (4 beats), the controller will:
    -   Check active effects at each time frame (e.g., at 1649ms).
    -   Render rainbow coloring first.
    -   Apply the blinking effect over it.
    -   Transmit the final HSV values to the physical LED strip.
-   At 100 pixels, if the last effect in sequence is BLUE, the strip will display blue across all pixels.
