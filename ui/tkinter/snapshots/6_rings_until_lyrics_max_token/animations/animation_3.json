    "instruction": "I want that for the first 8 beats, only one ring is turned on at every beat. You can reuse rings that were already on (e.g. we have 6 rings, and 8 beats, so some rings might be turned twice)\nthen on the second bar you can turn multiple rings together",
    "reasoning": "For this revised animation, I'll create a sequence where only one ring is illuminated during each of the first 8 beats (covering bars 0 and 1). Since we have 6 rings (ring7 through ring12) but need to cover 8 beats, I'll reuse two rings strategically to maintain visual interest.\n\nFor the first bar (beats 0-3), I'll activate each ring individually in sequence from left to right (ring7 to ring10).\nFor the second bar (beats 4-7), I'll continue with ring11 and ring12, then reuse ring7 and ring8 with different effects to keep the animation fresh.\n\nThen, starting at bar 2 (beat 8), I'll activate multiple rings together with coordinated effects to create a more dynamic and expansive visual display, signaling the progression of the music.",
