    "instruction": "Generate an animation for the first 2 bars of the aladdin song with pink blinking light for bar 1 and blue blinking light for bar 2",
    "reasoning": "I've created a 2-bar animation for the Aladdin song with distinct colored blinking lights for each bar:\n\nBar 1 (0ms to 7990ms): Features a vibrant pink blinking light as requested in the first prompt. The pink color (hue: 0.83) blinks smoothly using a sine wave pattern that completes 4 cycles during the bar, varying from 20% to 100% brightness.\n\nBar 2 (7990ms to 15406ms): Transitions to a blue blinking light (hue: 0.6) as requested in the second prompt. I've maintained the same blinking pattern (4 cycles per bar, brightness varying from 20% to 100%) for consistency, but with the new blue color.\n\nThis creates a nice visual progression from pink to blue while maintaining the same rhythmic blinking pattern throughout both bars. The timing is precisely aligned with the song's bar structure based on the provided timing information.",
