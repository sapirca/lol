Covers beats 0-4 (from 0.575ms to 4.283ms)\n2. Uses all rings (7-12)\n3. Creates a blinking effect with purple color\n4. Keeps it simple as requested\n\nI received an error in my previous attempt because I set both \"const_color\" and \"brightness\" effects in the same effect configuration. According to the schema, I should set exactly one effect type per effect configuration. I'll create two separate effects instead - one for the color and one for the brightness.\n\nActions plan:\n- Create an animation with a purple blinking effect for the first 4 beats\n- If the user wants to modify the animation, get the current animation and make changes\n- If the user wants to extend the animation to more beats, create additional effects\n\nI will execute action:\nupdate_animation",
