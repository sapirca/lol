The user has provided detailed information about the song structure, including bars, beats, key points, and lyrics. Based on their memory, they prefer purple and orange colors with hue shifts, sometimes like pastel colors, and enjoy increasing fade-in effects. I'll create an animation that synchronizes with the music, using their preferred colors and effects while following the song structure.\n\nFor this animation, I'll create effects that match the emotional journey of the song, starting with the mellow storytelling beginning, building up to the chorus, and incorporating special effects for key moments like the \"crazy boom\" sections. I'll use the user's preferred purple and orange color palette with hue shifts, implement snake effects, and ensure different elements are animated efficiently.",
